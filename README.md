Project Name: Blackjack

Project Description: Blackjack is a casino banked game, meaning that players compete against the house rather than each other. The objective is to get a hand total of closer to 21 than the dealer without                      going over 21 (busting). At the start of a Blackjack game, the players and the dealer receive two cards each. The players' cards are normally dealt face up, while the dealer has one                        face down (called the hole card) and one face up.

                     How do you beat the dealer?
                     
                     - By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealer's hand value
                     -

                     How do you beat the dealer?

                     - By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealer’s hand value
                     - By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.
                     - By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.

                     How do you lose to the dealer? 

                     - Your hand value exceeds 21.
                     - The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round

Game Instructions: First choose your wager amount by clicking on one of the betting chips on the screen. Then click on "DEAL" to get your first two cards. You can then continue to get dealt cards by clicking "HIT". When you want to stop receiving cards, click on "STAND". The dealer will then turn over their hole card and continue to deal themselves cards as long as their total is under 17 or they bust. Your cash balance will either increase or decrease by your wager amount based off who won the hand. If you and the dealer end up with the same total, then that hand is a push.  

Next Steps: Add ability to doubledown, split cards, surrender, and ability to choose if the value of an Ace is 1 or 11.
